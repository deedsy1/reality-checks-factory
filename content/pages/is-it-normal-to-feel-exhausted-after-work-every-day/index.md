Many people feel wiped out after work—especially during demanding periods. In many cases it’s a normal response to sustained effort, overstimulation, or poor recovery time.

This page helps you tell the difference between “tired but okay” and “tired in a way that keeps getting worse.”

## What “normal” can look like
- You feel tired, but you recover on weekends or after a good night’s sleep.
- Your energy dips at predictable times, like late afternoon.
- You can still do small enjoyable things (food, a walk, a show), even if you’re not “sparkly.”

## Common reasons this happens
- Cognitive overload (constant switching, meetings, notifications)
- Emotional labor (customer-facing work, conflict, masking)
- Low recovery time between work and life
- Sleep debt or inconsistent sleep schedule
- Commute and logistics draining the day

## Simple reality checks
- Are you sleeping enough to feel even slightly restored?
- Does your exhaustion ease when workload reduces?
- Are you “tired” or “numb and flat”?
- Do you dread the next day even after rest?
- Have you stopped enjoying things you usually like?

## When it might be a sign of a bigger issue
If exhaustion is persistent and worsening (weeks/months), or it comes with hopelessness, frequent shutdown, or you’re unable to recover with rest, that can be a sign you may need more support or a change in load. This isn’t a diagnosis—just a cue to take the pattern seriously and consider talking with a trusted professional or support person.

## Small ways people reduce the load (non-prescriptive)
- Create a “decompression buffer” after work (10–20 minutes)
- Reduce context-switching when possible
- Make evenings simpler for a while (lower the bar)
- Protect one recovery habit (sleep, walk, food, quiet)

## FAQs
**Q:** Is it normal to be tired after a desk job?  
**A:** Yes. Mental work can be draining even without physical effort, especially if it’s high-pressure or interruption-heavy.

**Q:** What if I’m tired even after weekends?  
**A:** That can happen after long stress periods. If it persists, it may be a sign you’re not getting real recovery.

**Q:** Does everyone feel like this?  
**A:** Many do at times, but not everyone feels exhausted every single day. Frequency and recovery matter.

**Q:** Is this burnout?  
**A:** Burnout has patterns like persistent exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced effectiveness. Daily tiredness alone isn’t enough to conclude anything.

**Q:** Can lifestyle alone fix it?  
**A:** Sometimes small changes help, but workload and stressors often play a big role too.

**Q:** When should I seek help?  
**A:** If it’s persistent, worsening, or affecting your ability to function, it can be worth talking to a professional.
