**Feeling occasional resentment toward colleagues is a common human experience that usually points to situational stress rather than a personal failing.**

## What this feeling usually means

Resentment often emerges when you sense an imbalance—whether in workload, recognition, or respect. It typically signals that something in your environment feels unfair or that your boundaries are being stretched, rather than indicating a fundamental flaw in your character. This emotion serves as data, alerting you to needs that may not be getting met.

## Common reasons

- **Perceived inequity**: Watching others receive praise or opportunities that feel disproportionate to their contribution
- **Workload imbalances**: Consistently absorbing tasks that others avoid or delegate
- **Boundary erosion**: Colleagues who interrupt focused work, overshare personal details, or expect immediate responses
- **Values misalignment**: Differences in work ethics, communication styles, or professional standards
- **Scarcity mindsets**: Competition for limited resources, promotions, or visibility in flat organizational structures
- **Exhaustion**: Fatigue amplifies irritability, making minor annoyances feel like major grievances

## What makes it worse

- **Suppressing the emotion**: Pushing resentment down without acknowledgment often causes it to leak out through passive comments or physical tension
- **Rumination loops**: Replaying interactions mentally without resolution keeps the nervous system activated
- **Comparison spirals**: Measuring your effort against others' visible output while ignoring invisible struggles
- **Isolation**: Withdrawing from casual workplace connection eliminates the buffer of shared humanity
- **Over-identification with work**: When your job dominates your identity, workplace friction feels like a threat to your sense of self

## What helps (non-advice)

- **Name the specific trigger**: Move from "I hate them" to "I feel overlooked when they speak over me in meetings"
- **Check the timeline**: Notice whether the feeling is tied to a specific project phase or is persistent across contexts
- **Adjust proximity**: If possible, create physical or digital distance from triggering interactions during high-stress periods
- **Externalize the narrative**: Discuss the dynamic with someone outside your organization to gain perspective without workplace politics
- **Separate person from pattern**: Notice if you're reacting to an individual's behavior or a systemic issue (like understaffing)
- **Release the vigilance**: Practice brief transitions between work tasks to prevent emotional residue from accumulating

## When it might signal a bigger issue

- **Physical manifestations**: Chronic tension, sleep disruption, or appetite changes that coincide with workdays
- **Generalization**: When resentment spreads to neutral colleagues or poisons your view of the entire organization
- **Avoidance behaviors**: Regularly calling in sick, delaying necessary collaborations, or fantasizing about abrupt exits
- **Intensity mismatch**: Reactions that feel out of proportion to the triggering event, suggesting cumulative stress
- **Duration**: Persistent daily distress lasting more than a few weeks without fluctuation

## FAQs

**Does feeling resentful mean I'm jealous or petty?**
Not necessarily. Resentment often reflects a value you hold deeply—fairness, collaboration, or quality. The feeling itself is neutral; it's information about what matters to you.

**Should I talk to my coworker about these feelings?**
Direct confrontation isn't always required. Sometimes internal processing or adjusting your own boundaries resolves the charge. If you do choose to communicate, focus on specific behaviors rather than character judgments.

**Can resentment ever be productive?**
Yes—it can motivate you to advocate for clearer role definitions, request better resources, or recognize when it's time to seek a different team or organization. The discomfort often precedes necessary change.

**What if the resentment is mutual?**
Mirror dynamics are common. If you sense tension from a colleague, consider whether you're inadvertently contributing to a cycle of misunderstanding. Neutral kindness without over-efforting sometimes resets the pattern.

**Will changing jobs fix this?**
Sometimes, but if resentment follows you across multiple workplaces, it may reflect internal patterns around boundaries or expectations worth exploring regardless of location.
