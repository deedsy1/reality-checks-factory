# Content plan / queue for idempotent generation.
#
# Generator behavior:
# - Consumes up to PAGES_PER_RUN items with status: todo
# - Writes content/pages/<slug>/index.md
# - Marks items as status: done (and sets generated_date)
#
# You can pre-fill hub/page_type to pin classification, or omit them to let the model choose.

items:
  - title: "Example: Is it normal to feel anxious before a big trip?"

    hub: "work-career"   # optional
    page_type: "is-it-normal"  # optional
